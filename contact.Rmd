For general information about the European Scenario Hub, our [Github repository](https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-scenario-hub-europe/issues/new) is typically the most up to date source. 

For updates on new scenario rounds, upcoming meetings, and results, all are welcome to join the European Scenario Hub [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/0/g/euro-covid19-scenario-hub). Please include your name and a brief sentence about your interest in the Hub (so that we can exclude bots). 

We welcome enquiries about the European Scenario Hub and we are keen to hear from modellers interested in participating. To get in touch, please:

- Send us an email at [mail@covid19scenariohub.eu](mailto:mail@covid19scenariohub.eu)

- Open a [Github Issue](https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-scenario-hub-europe/issues/new)

We also have a [Slack](https://slack.com/) workspace for all those interested in the Hub - please get in touch for the invite link.

Both the European Scenario and Forecast Hubs are run in collaboration between the [Epiforecasts team](http://epiforecasts.io/), part of the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases](http://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19) at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](http://www.lshtm.ac.uk), and the [European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)](http://ecdc.europa.eu). The LSHTM team working on Hub research and development includes [Katharine Sherratt](https://epiforecasts.io/people.html#katharine-sherratt) ([@kathsherratt](https://twitter.com/kathsherrratt)), [Hugo Gruson](https://epiforecasts.io/people.html#hugo-gruson) ([@grusonh](https://twitter.com/grusonh), and [Sebastian Funk](https://epiforecasts.io/people.html#sebastian-funk) ([@sbfnk](https://twitter.com/sbfnk)).
